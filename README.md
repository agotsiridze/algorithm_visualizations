# Algorithm Visualizations

## Overview

This project aims to provide clear and straightforward visualizations for various algorithms using Python. The goal is to offer a simple and easily comprehensible representation of each algorithm's functionality.

## Installation

To initiate the project, ensure you have Python 3 and the pip package manager installed. Run the following command in the terminal to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Each algorithm is encapsulated within an individual file. To visualize a specific algorithm, execute the following command in the terminal:

```bash
python <filename.py>
```

## Project Goal

The primary objective of this project is to present the simplest and most lucid means of visualizing algorithms. The emphasis is on clarity and accessibility in order to facilitate a better understanding of algorithmic processes.
